function [rob_mat, idx, flag] = find_next(OPEN)
%UNTITLED2 Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
% delete those nodes which are not in OPEN
OPEN(:, 8) = OPEN(:, 8) .* (~OPEN(:, 1) .* inf);

% use min function to find the row number which has the lowest fn
[fn_min, idx] = min(OPEN(:, 8));

if fn_min == inf
    rob_mat = [0, 0];
    flag = 0; % can't find next node
    return 
else
    rob_mat = OPEN(idx, 2:3); % output the idx
    flag =
